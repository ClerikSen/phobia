PMC is an open project that aims to build the quality permanent magnet
synchronous machine (PMSM) controller for use in a variety of scopes like RC or
electric transport.

## Brief

PMC is ready to use in most intended applications. You can flash any supported
third-party hardware to work with PMC or use our original hardware.

Read further in [doc/GettingStarted](doc/GettingStarted.md).

There are a few videos about PMC on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@romblv).

## Software features

- Sensorless vector control of PMSM by measurement of currents and voltages.
- Robust ORTEGA observer with gain scheduling against speed.
- Accurate KALMAN observer having convergence at HF injection.
- Flux weakening and MTPA control (**EXPERIMENTAL**).
- Three and two phase machine support.
- Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) over STM32F4 and STM32F7.
- Various controller hardware are supported (including VESC clones).
- Regular Command Line Interface (CLI) with autocompletion and history.
- Graphical front-end software based on
  [Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) and
  [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/).
- Non time-critical tasks are managed by
  [FreeRTOS](http://www.freertos.org/).
- USB protocol stack from
  [CherryUSB](https://github.com/sakumisu/CherryUSB).
- Least Squares estimate library
  [LSE](https://github.com/rombrew/lse).

- Phase current sampling schemes includes two or three sensors configuration
  with inline or low-side placement.
- Self-adjustment of all onboard measurements (current and voltage) along
  symmetrical channels.

- Advanced SVPWM scheme provides:
	- Reduced switching losses and fully utilised DC link voltage.
	- Reduced voltage distortion for precise control.
	- Voltage hopping to get accurate ADC measurements with inline current sensors.
	- Prevent bootstrap circuit undervoltage condition.

- Terminal voltage measurements (TVM):
	- Compensation of the voltage distortion caused by dead-time insertion.
	- Back EMF voltage tracking to catch an already running machine.
	- Self-test of the power stages integrity and machine wiring.
	- Self-test of bootstrap retention time.

- Automated machine parameters identification (with no external tools):
	- Stator DC resistance (Rs).
	- Stator AC impedance in DQ frame (L1, L2, R).
	- Rotor flux linkage constant (lambda).
	- Mechanical moment of inertia (Ja).

- Automated configuration of external measurements:
	- Discrete Hall sensors installation angles recognition.
	- EABI resolution and direction adjustment.

- Operation at low or zero speed:
	- Forced control that applies a current vector without feedback to
	  force rotor hold or spinup.
	- Freewheeling.
	- High Frequency Injection (HFI) based on magnetic saliency.
	- Discrete Hall sensors.
	- AB quadrature incremental encoder (EABI).
	- Absolute encoder on SPI interface (AS5047).
	- Analog Hall sensors and resolver decoder (**TODO**).

- Nested control loops:
	- Detached voltage monitoring.
	- Current control PI regulator with feedforward compensation.
	- Speed control PID regulator with load torque compensation.
	- Location control with constant acceleration regulator.

- Adjustable constraints:
	- Phase current (forward and reverse, on HFI current, weakening D current).
	- Hardware overtemperature protection (decrease phase current or halt).
	- Machine voltage applied from VSI.
	- DC link current consumption and regeneration.
	- DC link overvoltage and undervoltage.
	- Maximal speed (forward and reverse) and acceleration.
	- Absolute location maximal and minimal limit.

- Input control interfaces:
	- Analog input knob with brake signal.
	- RC servo pulse width modulation.
	- CAN bus flexible configurable data transfers.
	- STEP/DIR (or CW/CCW) interface (**EXPERIMENTAL**).
	- Manual control through CLI or graphical front-end.
	- Custom embedded application can implement any control strategy.

- Advanced CAN networking:
	- Up to 30 nodes in peer network.
	- Network survey on request (no heartbeat messages).
	- Automated node address assignment.
	- IO forwarding to log in to the remote node CLI.
	- Flexible configurable data transfers.

- Available information:
	- Machine state (electrical position, speed, load torque, etc.)
	- DC link voltage and current consumption.
	- Information from temperature sensors.
	- Total distance traveled.
	- Battery energy (Wh) and charge (Ah) consumed.
